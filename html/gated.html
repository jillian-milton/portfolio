            <p class="about">For my Honors Senior Thesis in Web Design, I built Gated, a mobile app that helps college students meet their academic needs in a closed community. I spent the first half of the year doing market research and conducting surveys to see what students wanted. Then, by the end of 2023, I created a wireframe and a prototype in Figma to envision Gated’s look and feel. Finally, during the Spring 2024 semester, I programmed the front-end and the back-end of the app, wrote a 145-page long thesis paper, and presented my work to the STEM Scholar community. 
            </p>
            <p class="about">A current problem at UConn was that students cannot find peers in their major or unbiased professor reviews. To quantify the need, I surveyed 301 UConn students, and 66% of them wanted an academic app. Gated was coded with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a PostgreSQL database.
    
            </p>
            <p class="about">In my design process, I developed user personas, or fictional characters, to represent key audience segments. Some of them include “Group Chat Charley” and “Grad School Gary.” Group Chat Charley is struggling with her Accounting class this semester. By using the Search People feature, she can search for students in her course. The app will generate search results so that she can create a group chat. Grad School Gary is Med-School bound. He wants to research future professors to maintain a high GPA. Gary can go to Search Courses and search for Chemistry professors. He can see each of their reviews based on other Gated users. Gated demonstrates that UX design can help students create purposeful connections to meet their academic needs.  </p>
