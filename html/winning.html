            <p class="about">This project was for my Interaction Design class at UConn. This course strengthened my skills as a User Experience Designer and exposed me to different careers in the field. The final project for the course was to design a mobile app for the healthcare industry. </p>
            <p class="about">The app I made called “Winning Habits” is a pill-reminder app that motivates senior citizens to take their pills through a Blackjack game. I was inspired by my own need to remember to take pills consistently, but after my user research, I realized that it would make more sense to target senior citizens since they have a lot of medications to keep track of. Each habit, such as taking medication or flossing your teeth, gets assigned an icon (yellow circle for medication and green circle for flossing). When the user marks the icon on the calendar, that translates into a Black Jack chip that they could use to win gift cards. The four dot motif represents the different colored icons or Black Jack chips, while the dark green, inspired by the felt of a casino table, is a nod to the gaming experience and adds cohesiveness to the app. I experimented with a cleaner design, and larger fonts geared to an older audience. I received a 97 on this project.
