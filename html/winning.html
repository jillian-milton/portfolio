            <p class="about">For my Interaction Design class at UConn, we were tasked with designing a mobile app for the healthcare industry. I created <i>Winning Habits</i>, a pill-reminder app that motivates senior citizens to take their pills through gaming and gift cards. I was inspired by my own need to remember to take pills consistently. After my user research, I decided to focus on the senior citizens segment since they have numerous medications to manage. Each habit, such as taking medication or flossing your teeth, gets assigned an icon (yellow circle for medication and green circle for flossing). When the user marks the icon on the calendar indicating a completed task, they earn a Black Jack chip that they can use to play and potentially win gift cards. The four dot motif represents the different colored icons or Black Jack chips, while the dark green, inspired by the felt of a casino table, is a nod to the gaming experience and adds cohesiveness to the app. I experimented with a cleaner design and larger fonts geared to an older audience.
