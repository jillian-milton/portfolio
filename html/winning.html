            <p class="about">For my Interaction Design class at UConn, we were tasked with designing a mobile app for the healthcare industry. I created <i>Winning Habits</i>, a pill-reminder app that motivates senior citizens to take their pills through gaming and gift cards. I was inspired by my own need to remember to take pills consistently. After my user research, I decided to focus on the senior citizens segment since they have numerous medications to manage. Each habit, such as taking medication or flossing your teeth, gets assigned an icon (yellow circle for medication and green circle for flossing). When the user marks the icon on the calendar indicating a completed task, they earn a Black Jack chip that they can use to play and potentially win gift cards. The four dot motif represents the different colored icons or Black Jack chips, while the dark green, inspired by the felt of a casino table, is a nod to the gaming experience and adds cohesiveness to the app. I experimented with a cleaner design and larger fonts geared to an older audience.

        alt="Smartphone screen showing a social media app called 'Husky Hub', styled with red, white, and blue branding. The top of the screen shows the time (1:47) and a logo with overlapping red and blue H’s. The interface features a vertical feed of posts. The first post is by @UCONNROCKS with the caption 'Final 4 baby!!!!' and a short looping video of someone playing an arcade basketball game. Below, the same user posts again, asking, 'Anyone else get their cap and gown today????' and adds, 'Feeling sad that my time’s almost up :// Also why is the School of Fine Arts Tassle Shit Brown!!!!' Reaction icons appear under the post: bookmark, heart, speech bubble, and refresh. The next post is from @UCONNHUSKIES and includes a looping video of an adult dunking a basketball on a toy hoop over a door while a child falls to the ground. The bottom navigation bar has five icons: a person silhouette, Twitter bird, the Husky Hub logo, a speech bubble, and a bookmark. A large red circular button with a plus sign for creating a new post floats in the bottom right.">
