            <p class="about">For my senior digital media capstone course, I worked with a group of two other students to build a website and a marketing plan for a barber in Meriden, CT. One student was a web design major and the other was a business major. The barber had a new invention called “The BOSS,” a portable device to clean hair off of clippers. The right side of The BOSS blew the hair off the clippers, and the left side sanitized them by squirting cleaning liquid. The barber needed a new website to promote his product. 

            </p>
            <p class="about">My group came up with color palettes and slogans. We chose a bold, masculine font and traditional barbershop colors: red, white, blue, and orange. The barber even drove to UConn to do a photoshoot of “The BOSS” with us. We recruited a photography major from the class to edit the pictures for us. Once the pictures were edited, they were put into the Figma mockup and eventually onto the real site in Wix. </p>
            <p class="about">My role of the group was helping choose the colors, fonts, slogans, and design choices. I also created a social media content calendar as part of a marketing strategy for “The BOSS.” The product was not ready to go to market yet, so the barber did not use the calendar.
