    alt='A laptop screen displays a website for a grooming product called "The Boss." The headline reads, ‘Become the boss of your clippers.’ Below that, smaller text says the product is designed for efficiency, keeping grooming tools sharp, organized, and protected from bacteria. A blue button beneath the text says ‘Coming to Amazon Soon.’ On the right side of the screen is an image of the product: a black clipper holder with compartments, labeled "The Boss." The top navigation has links labeled ‘Home’ and ‘How to Use.’ The bottom edge of the screen has a repeating red-and-white graphic that says ‘Boss It’ in all capital letters.'>

            <p class="about">For my senior digital media capstone course, I worked with two other students to build a website and a marketing plan for a barber in Meriden, CT. The barber had a new invention called <i>The BOSS</i>, a portable device to clean hair from clippers. The right side of <i>The BOSS</i> blew the hair off the clippers, and the left side sanitized them by squirting cleaning liquid. The barber needed a website to promote his product. My group came up with color palettes and slogans. We chose a bold, masculine font and traditional barbershop colors: red, white, blue, and orange. We used original photography and video product demonstration in the Figma mockup and eventually onto the website. I also created a social media content calendar as part of a marketing strategy for <i>The BOSS</i>.

    alt='A social media content calendar for The Boss brand for December 2023. The calendar shows scheduled posts for Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. Each platform is color-coded: Instagram is orange, TikTok is black, Facebook is blue, and YouTube is red. The calendar includes different content types such as Instagram Reels, Grid Posts, TikTok videos, Facebook Stories and Posts, and YouTube Shorts and a Long video. Content is scheduled several times a week, with Instagram and Facebook posts appearing most frequently on Mondays and Fridays, TikToks on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and YouTube Shorts mostly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The key is shown on the right-hand side, and The Boss logo appears in the bottom right corner.'>
