            <i>Blind Pioneers</i> began as a final project for a summer course in 2021. In the blind community, I observed that there was a gap: no single website assembled vital aspects of students’ educational needs. This was especially evident in the area of up-to-date technology. This site emphasized demonstration since it was aimed to the typically sighted audience, educators and parents, who had never done this before and were embarking on a unique journey. Many likened the experience of educating a blind student to “walking on the moon,” hence the space explorer idea. I only had five weeks to build the website, and I solicited original articles from my network, even creating an editorial board to review the content. I wanted the student contributors to explain in their own words, the techniques that work for them in the “Perspectives Section.” Since this was an exercise in content creation and management, I used a Wix template for speed. Later in the redesign of 2022, I would change the structure of the site to improve the navigation. This site continues to be used and shared among parents and educators.
