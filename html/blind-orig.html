          <p class="about">Blind Pioneers began as a final project for a summer course in 2021, which I have since revisited.  In the blind community, there is no single website that encompasses all aspects of student’s educational needs, especially in the area of up-to-date technology and demonstration. I only had five weeks to build the website for the class, so I decided to focus more on the content and use a Wix template.  </p>
          
          <p class="about">The “Perspectives” section is articles written by students about overcoming challenges and life as a blind student in mainstreamed education. The “Perspectives” section also features videos of blind students demonstrating how they use assistive technology inside and outside of the classroom. There are also daily living videos as well as educational and advocacy resources. I had to work quickly to identify contributors and review content. I learned about information architecture and how to organize content in an easy and meaningful way. As my first portfolio project, Blind Pioneers made me excited about my future web design courses. </p>
