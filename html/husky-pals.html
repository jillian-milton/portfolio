           <p class="about">This was a project from my User Interface Design course at UConn. The assignment was to design an app that solved a problem. An ongoing problem was that since COVID, college students felt more isolated at large colleges such as UConn and needed a way to make friends that was less awkward. Perhaps students could input their information such as which dorm they lived in, their major, their favorite dining hall, and clubs, allowing others to search for them with categorized filters. Then once they’ve matched with someone, they can start texting them about dinner plans within the app. There is also a feature that hypothetically lets users see a seating map of each dining hall this way they can text their friends, “Meet me at table 5 at South Dining Hall.”</p>
            
           <p class="about">Ultimately, “Husky Pals” helps students find others with similar interests so that they can meet in dining halls to expand their network while getting answers to questions like: Do I want to join this club, or change my major, or live in another dorm? This purposeful connection is much less awkward or intimidating rather than having dinner with a stranger. This concept of meeting people based on interests later inspired my Honors Senior Thesis, Gated. I learned more advanced design skills such as how to align and center elements on the screen, as well as categorizing with drop-downs. </p>
