    alt="A laptop screen displays the homepage of the UConn Athletic Bands website, part of the School of Fine Arts. The main image shows a marching band performing in a football stadium. A band member in full uniform, including a black beret and gloves, is playing a silver sousaphone. The stadium is filled with spectators, and bright stadium lights illuminate the field at dusk. The website menu includes options like About, Join, Events, Ensembles, Outreach, and Members Only.">

           <p class="about">I played marimba and piano in the UConn Marching Band (UCMB). In March of 2022, I was the UCMB Assistant Webmaster and served as head Webmaster from August 2022 to December 2023. As Webmaster, my job was to update and maintain the content on the website. I also managed the Web Team, which was about ten band students, to maximize the website's impact. This involved a lot of detail-oriented work that took many hours, such as inputting information about drum majors, section leaders, and officers. I delegated tasks to the team and followed up to make sure things were completed. In addition, I wrote minutes of the web team meetings and presented updates at weekly band council meetings.

           </p>

           <p class="about">This role also involved learning WordPress and teaching others how to use it. When I first became Webmaster, the UConn Marching Band website (now called UConn Athletic Bands website) was in the process of a redesigned, so I made some coding and design changes and ultimately published the current version of the website in October 2022. For the next year, I focused on making the UConn Athletic Bands website more of a recruiting tool to encourage high schoolers to join. To accomplish this, I updated the Home page with current videos of our field shows. I also updated the Events page at the beginning of every season and made a new page called "TUP (Talent, Unity, Pride) Awards," highlighting exemplary new members.

    alt='A webpage section titled "TUP Awards." The page describes that TUP stands for Talent, Unity, and Pride, a motto of the marching band. It explains that each Friday of the season, 2â€“3 band members are recognized for excellence on and off the field and receive a TUP Award ribbon. The left image shows a tall metal tower structure against a sunset sky with trees at the base. The right image shows a handmade award ribbon with a yellow circle that says "TUP" in brown letters, bordered by red trim and purple and green hanging ribbons.'>
