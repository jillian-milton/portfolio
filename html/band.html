           <p class="about">I played marimba and piano in the UConn Marching Band (UCMB). In March of 2022, I was the UCMB Assistant Webmaster and served as head Webmaster from August 2022 to December 2023. As Webmaster, my job was to update and maintain the content on the website. I also managed the Web Team, which was about ten band students, to maximize the website's impact. This involved a lot of detail-oriented work that took many hours, such as inputting information about drum majors, section leaders, and officers. I delegated tasks to the team and followed up to make sure things were completed. In addition, I wrote minutes of the web team meetings and presented updates at weekly band council meetings.

           </p>

           <p class="about">This role also involved learning WordPress and teaching others how to use it. When I first became Webmaster, the UConn Marching Band website (now called UConn Athletic Bands website) was in the process of a redesigned, so I made some coding and design changes and ultimately published the current version of the website in October 2022. For the next year, I focused on making the UConn Athletic Bands website more of a recruiting tool to encourage high schoolers to join. To accomplish this, I updated the Home page with current videos of our field shows. I also updated the Events page at the beginning of every season and made a new page called "TUP (Talent, Unity, Pride) Awards," highlighting exemplary new members.
