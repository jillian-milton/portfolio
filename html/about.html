            <p class="about">My name is Jillian Milton, and I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media and Design (Web/Interactive Media Design concentration) and a minor in Digital Marketing and Analytics. I also graduated as a STEM Scholar, a prestigious scholarship that is given to 75 students out of a 5000-person class who are pursuing STEM fields. All STEM Scholars take Honors courses in their major and write an Honors Thesis. My thesis was about a mobile app I developed called Gated, which is on the Portfolio page. </p>
        
            <p class="about">I enjoy using creativity and data to solve real-world problems. As far as technical skills, I have 2 years of experience working in Figma UX design software, 2 years of JavaScript, 3 years of HTML/CSS, and 1 year in React Native. I pride myself in being versatile because I am skilled at many digital media tasks. My career goal is to make websites accessible for everyone. I aspire to work in the field of user experience so that users of all abilities can interact positively with technology.</p>
