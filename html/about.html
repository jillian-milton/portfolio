            <p class="about">My name is Jillian Milton, and I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media and Design (Web/ Interactive Media Design concentration) and a minor in Digital Marketing and Analytics. I graduated as an Honors STEM Scholar: a distinction given to only 75 students in a class of about 5,800 people. All STEM Scholars take Honors courses in their major and write an Honors Thesis. For my thesis project, I researched and developed a mobile app which I named <i>Gated</i> (see the Portfolio page).  </p>
        
            <p class="about">I enjoy using creativity and data to solve real-world problems. I have two years of experience working in Figma UX design software, two years in JavaScript, three years in HTML/CSS, and one year in React Native. My career goal is to make websites and digital products accessible to everyone. I aspire to work in the field of user experience so that users of all abilities can interact successfully with technology.</p>
